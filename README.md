# Class Scheduler Booking App

## Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree - Capstone Project

In Tech Ed, we are always advancing technology to provide school faculty and instructors to better utilize resources. We have created a booking application that enables Faculty members to manage all lecture bookings and classrooms, as well as Instructors of classes to search for available classrooms, create new lectures, update existing lectures, and delete their lectures.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask server with a SQLAlchemy module running on PostgreSQL. Required endpoints are found in `app.py`, database models in `models.py`, environment variables in a bash file `setup.sh`, and this has been configured using Auth0 Authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. `@TODO FIGURE OUT FRONTEND!!!! Environment variables are found within (./frontend/somethingsomething) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app.`

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)

### Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku using the `setup.sh` bash file.
